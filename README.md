# Mobilephone App for AC
Chat replacement app in the style of an old phone.

If you're looking for a more "modern" feel, try my [Smartphone](https://github.com/C1XTZ/ac-smartphone/) app.

### Current Features:

- **Ingame App Updater**
- **Current IRL or Track time - Left click to switch between IRL and track, right click to send to chat**
- **Currently playing song - Left click to switch scroll direction, right click to send to chat**
- **Ingame chat - Right click a message to @mention the sender**
- **Sound notifications - Join/Leave events, @mentions, or simply every message**
- **Broken screen on impacts - Shattered glass on light, completely destroyed screen on heavy impacts**
- **Hides annoying messages from other apps**
    - Example: `PLP: running version 1.21, 2-60-3-True-3.3-0.9-3-2-8-5-0|C1XTZ`
- **Many adjustable settings to suit your preferences as seen below - images might be outdated, always check ingame**
